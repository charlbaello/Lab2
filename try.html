                I'am Good, always excited <br>
                I'am from Taguig City
        
                <p>I am a jolly person always wanted to laugh, I'm a risk taker person,<br>
                My daily hobbies are:
                Playing Basketball, Guitar and i like to travel a lot.<br>
                <p>How's My Summer Vacation?</p>
                My summer vacation is great since I enjoyed every moments on It. Sometimes I travel by my self going to Baguio since It is my birthplace.<br>
                I really like unexpected adventures, It's because unexpected always happens, rather than preparing until it become a drawing.<br>
                I kinda struggle at first but every time I learned different knowledge I'm starting to like and like the course from time to time.<br>
                Well I enjoyed my summer a lot because I have freedom and i travel by myself too.<br>
                And also I have more time with my family, do the things that i haven't do when class still up, eventually I enjoyed my summer vacation.
                <p>What's My Expectation In UserDes Subject?</p>
                My expectation In this class is to have fun while learning, balance, learn new things in this subject, since i don't have any idea about this subject yet
